# Contributing
    
We very much appreciate your wanting to contribute to Annoto projects, but we need to add you to the contributors list first.

Before we can accept a Pull Request from you, please sign [our CLA](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2jn5cqBr2_ovLOGt3ars537Tu5s6TZ013QU6IJ-MsnEYuKg/viewform).

Note that the CLA agreement is not a transfer of copyright ownership, it is simply is a license agreement for contributions. You also do not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

This is part of the legal framework of the open-source ecosystem that adds some red tape, but protects both the contributor and the company / foundation behind the project. It also gives us the option to relicense the code with a more permissive license in the future.
